<h1>SQL INNER JOIN</h1>
<p>
In SQL, the Keyword <b>INNER JOIN</b> is used to combine data from columns in multiple tables. It selects records that have 
matching data in these tables <b>ON</b> matching entries from specified columns. For example, lets say we have two tables called
Students and Teachers and each have a column called Name, which is the name of the student or teacher, and a column called 
Color, which is the favorite color of the student or teacher. So, if you want to find all the teachers and students who's 
favorite color is green you might have something like this: <br /><br />
<b>SELECT</b> <i>Students.Name, Teachers.Name, Students.Color</i><br />
<b>FROM</b> <i>Students</i><br />
<b>INNER JOIN</b> <i>Teachers</i><br />
<b>ON</b> <i>Students.Colors=Teachers.Colors</i><br />
<b>WHERE</b> <i>Color="green"</i>;<br /><br />
This commands <b>SELECT</b>s the names of students, names of teachers, and colors of students (although you could also select 
colors of teahcers), <b>FROM</b> the table 'Students' and <b>INNER JOINs it with 'Teachers' on the criteria that Student's Color
matches Teacher's Color where their colors are green. This will return all</b> the students and teacher's who's favorite 
color is green.
